# loan-Risk-Detection

This project aims to detect loan risk using machine learning techniques. The process involves collecting data from two datasets, namely application.csv and previous_application.csv, preprocessing the data to handle missing values and format the data appropriately, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between data and anomalies, and finally, utilizing the Random Forest algorithm to predict loan risk accuracy.

Data Collection
Two datasets are utilized:
application.csv: Contains data related to current loan applications.
previous_application.csv: Contains data related to previous loan applications.

Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the datasets are dealt with using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
Data Formatting: The data is formatted to ensure compatibility with the chosen machine learning algorithm.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to:
Understand the distribution of variables.
Identify correlations between features.
Detect anomalies or outliers.
Gain insights useful for model performance improvement.

Random Forest Algorithm
The Random Forest algorithm is employed for loan risk prediction due to its ability to handle large datasets and complex relationships between features.
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the Random Forest model is assessed using suitable evaluation metrics.
